#Project 1:
The Amazon web scraper project involves developing a Python script to extract product information from Amazon's website. The scraper retrieves data such as product titles, prices, ratings, reviews, and other relevant details from Amazon product pages. This information can be used for various purposes, including price tracking, market analysis, and product comparison. The project typically utilizes web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to parse HTML content and extract desired information from Amazon product pages. Additionally, the project may involve handling dynamic content loading using tools like Selenium for more complex scraping tasks. The extracted data can be stored in a structured format such as CSV or a database for further analysis or visualization.

#Project 2:

ðŸš€ Excited to share a Python script I've been working on for analyzing cryptocurrency data! ðŸ“ˆ

This script utilizes the CoinMarketCap API to fetch the latest cryptocurrency listings and then processes the data using the powerful pandas library in Python. The goal is to gain insights into cryptocurrency trends and price movements over time.
