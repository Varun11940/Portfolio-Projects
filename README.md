#Project 1:
The Amazon web scraper project involves developing a Python script to extract product information from Amazon's website. The scraper retrieves data such as product titles, prices, ratings, reviews, and other relevant details from Amazon product pages. This information can be used for various purposes, including price tracking, market analysis, and product comparison. The project typically utilizes web scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests to parse HTML content and extract desired information from Amazon product pages. Additionally, the project may involve handling dynamic content loading using tools like Selenium for more complex scraping tasks. The extracted data can be stored in a structured format such as CSV or a database for further analysis or visualization.

#Project 2:

ðŸš€ Excited to share a Python script I've been working on for analyzing cryptocurrency data! ðŸ“ˆ

This script utilizes the CoinMarketCap API to fetch the latest cryptocurrency listings and then processes the data using the powerful pandas library in Python. The goal is to gain insights into cryptocurrency trends and price movements over time.

#Project 3:
 The project is focused on enhancing data quality and organization. Initial steps involved standardizing the date format for SaleDate and ensuring accurate population of PropertyAddress data where missing, leveraging ParcelID matches. Subsequently, the address field was dissected into separate columns, facilitating more granular analysis. OwnerAddress underwent a similar treatment, with its components split into distinct fields for improved clarity. Moreover, the SoldAsVacant field was updated to use 'Yes' and 'No' for consistency. Duplicates were identified and removed based on key attributes to maintain data integrity. Finally, unnecessary columns were trimmed to optimize database efficiency. This comprehensive approach ensures the data is now more accurate, organized, and ready for in-depth analysis.

#Project 4: COVID Portfolio Project - Data Exploration.sql
The provided SQL code performs various analyses and calculations on COVID-19 data from the "PortfolioProject" database. It explores aspects such as total cases and deaths, infection rates, vaccination rates, and death rates across different countries and continents. The code utilizes SQL functions like joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), window functions, aggregate functions, and temp tables to perform these analyses. It also includes the creation of a view to store the data for later visualization.
